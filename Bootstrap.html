 		<p class="text-justify" style="margin-right: 10%;margin-left: 36%">Life is the aspect of existence that processes, acts, reacts, evaluates, and evolves through growth (reproduction and metabolism). The crucial difference between life and non-life (or non-living things) is that life uses energy for physical and conscious development. Life is anything that grows and eventually dies, i.e., ceases to proliferate and be cognizant. Can we say that viruses, for example, are cognizant? Yes, insofar as they react to stimuli; but they are alive essentially because they reproduce and grow. Computers are non-living because even though they can cognize, they do not develop biologically (grow), and cannot produce offspring. It is not cognition that determines life, then: it is rather proliferation and maturation towards a state of death; and death occurs only to living substances.
 			<br>
 			<br>

Or is the question, ‘What is the meaning (purpose) of life?’ That’s a real tough one. But I think that the meaning of life is the ideals we impose upon it, what we demand of it. I’ve come to reaffirm my Boy Scout motto, give or take a few words, that the meaning of life is to: Do good, Be Good, but also to Receive Good. The foggy term in this advice, of course, is ‘good’; but I leave that to the intuitive powers that we all share.

There are, of course, many intuitively clear examples of Doing Good: by retrieving a crying baby from a dumpster; by trying to rescue someone who’s drowning. Most of us would avoid murdering; and most of us would refrain from other acts we find intuitively wrong. So our natural intuitions determine the meaning of life for us; and it seems for other species as well, for those intuitions resonate through much of life and give it its purpose.The ceramic artist Edmund de Waal places an object in front of him and begins to tell a story. Even if the patina, chips and signs of repair of the inanimate object hint at its history, the story is told by a living observer. A living thing is an object that contains its story within itself. Life’s story is held in the genome, based in DNA. Maybe other ways for memorising the story may be discovered, but in environments subject to common chemical processes, common methods are likely to emerge.

Although we have only the example of the Earth, it shows that life will evolve to fill every usable niche, and to secure and further diversify those niches. This should not be thought of as purposeful. Life embodies a ‘plan’, but one that does not specify ends, only methods acquired iteratively. Inanimate processes can be cyclic but not iterative: they do not learn from past mistakes.

Life exists at many levels. Life is also a process through which energy and materials are transformed; but so is non-life. The difference is that the process of life is intimately linked to story it contains, whereas non-life is indifferent to the story we impose upon it. Yet life is only a story, so it can act only through matter. Therefore life is by nature a toolmaker. Its tools are potentially everything that exists, and its workshop is potentially the whole universe. So why do humans risk undermining the life of which they are part? Because they try to impose upon it a story of their own making. Yet humans, the ‘tool-making animals’, are themselves tools of life, in an unplanned experiment.
<br>
<br>
First the technical definition. Life is self-organising chemistry which reproduces itself and passes on its evolved characteristics, encoded in DNA. In thermodynamics terms, it has the ability to reduce local entropy or disorganisation, thus locally contravening the third law of thermodynamics.

   		<h3 style="margin-left: 6%; margin-top:3%;font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">6 Steps for Success in Life.</h3>
   		<br>
   		<p class="text-justify" style="margin-right: 36%;margin-left: 6%">
   			How do we define success? There are many different tactics for how to be successful in life, but the strategy that works best for you may depend on your view of success itself. We often think of it as doing well at work or earning a high salary. While professional accomplishments can be one piece of the puzzle, it leaves out many other important areas of life. Family, romantic relationships, academics, and athletics are just a few areas where people may strive for success.

Your individual definition of what success is exactly may vary, but many might define it as being fulfilled, happy, safe, healthy, and loved. It is the ability to reach your goals in life, whatever those goals may be.

So what can you do to boost your chances of achieving these things? What are some of the habits of successful people?

There is no single right way to be successful. What works for you might not work for someone else. There may not be a perfect combination of ingredients that can guarantee success, but there are some basic steps you can follow that can improve your chances of being successful in life, love, work, or whatever happens to be important to you.
Research by psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that there are two basic mindsets that influence how people think about themselves and their abilities: the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. People who possess a fixed mindset believe that things such as intelligence are static and unchangeable.
<br>
<br>
Those with a fixed mindset believe that success isn't a result of hard work—it's simply a consequence of innate talents. Because they believe that such talents are something people are either born with or without, they tend to give up more easily in the face of a challenge. They quit when things do not come easily because they believe that they lack the inborn skill needed to excel.

Those who have a growth mindset, on the other hand, feel that they can change, grow, and learn through effort. People who believe that they are capable of growth are more likely to achieve success. When things get tough, they look for ways to improve their skills and keep working toward success.

What can you do to build a growth mindset?

<h3 style="margin-left: 36%; margin-top:3%;font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">6 simple ways to love yourself more</h3>
   		<p class="text-justify" style="margin-right: 16%;margin-left: 36%">
   			One of the greatest struggles in recovery and in life is the struggle to accept and love ourselves, with all our shortcomings and imperfections. This can be extremely tough, but why? Why can’t we just believe the centuries-old wisdom that tells us we are good enough just the way we are? Why can’t we simply open our hearts and let our own love in? Because more often than not we simply don’t believe that we are worthy and lovable. Instead, we believe the negative voice inside our head that whispers messages of self-doubt and focuses on our shortcomings, rather than on our strengths. So what does it mean to love ourselves?

To love yourself means to respect and appreciate yourself as you are and to come to terms with those aspects of yourself that you can’t change – the aspects that make you unique. It means allowing yourself to drop the conditions that you have created to love yourself like, “I will love myself once I…”, and simply choose to embrace the good and the bad, the mistakes and the triumphs.
<br>
<br>
We have a tendency to focus on the things we don’t like about ourselves: Our flaws, insecurities, mistakes or fears. However, the more you focus on what you don’t like about yourself, the more those thoughts grow and turn into beliefs and start to shape your reality. Everything you perceive in the physical world has its origin in the invisible, inner world of your thoughts, beliefs and stories. When you choose to focus on yourself in a positive, compassionate way, you open yourself to seeing and realizing how amazing you already are. Take a couple minutes right now to think about the positive things about yourself, and to write down three things in your journal or on a sticky note.
